SafeSpace is a mobile and web application designed to help young adults and adolescents navigate mental distress. The app will provide tools, exercises, resources and a community to help alleviate mental distress. The initial version of the SafeSpace app will allow people to sign up, download the app and access channels and rooms to meet people in real-time. Future versions will include a guided journaling feature and an emotional assessment tool.
